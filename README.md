## üßÆ Case Scenario I ‚Äî Sales & Shipping Performance

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Which product category had the highest sales?**

SELECT TOP 1 
 ProductCategory,
 SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM OrderRecords
GROUP BY ProductCategory
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales**

-- Top 3 Regions
SELECT TOP 3 
    Region,
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM OrderRecords
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

-- Bottom 3 Regions
SELECT TOP 3 
    Region,
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM OrderRecords
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY TotalSales ASC;

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?**

SELECT 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalAppliancesSales_Ontario
FROM OrderRecords
WHERE ProductSubCategory = 'Appliances'
  AND Province = 'Ontario';

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers**


SELECT TOP 10 
    CustomerName,
    CustomerSegment,
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders,
    AVG(Sales) AS AvgOrderValue
FROM OrderRecords
GROUP BY CustomerName, CustomerSegment
ORDER BY TotalSales ASC;

**Recommendations**

* Launch loyalty and discount programs for low-spending customers.
* Upsell and cross-sell complementary products.
* Improve follow-up and customer engagement through personalized marketing.
* Offer subscription or contract-based supply options for small businesses.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?**

SELECT TOP 1 
    ShipMode,
    SUM(ShippingCost) AS TotalShippingCost
FROM OrderRecords
GROUP BY ShipMode
ORDER BY TotalShippingCost DESC;

## üìä Case Scenario II ‚Äî Customer and Profitability Insights

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?**

WITH TopCustomers AS (
    SELECT TOP 10
        CustomerName,
        CustomerSegment,
        SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales,
        SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit
    FROM OrderRecords
    GROUP BY CustomerName, CustomerSegment
    ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
)
SELECT 
    t.CustomerName,
    t.CustomerSegment,
    o.ProductCategory,
    SUM(o.Sales) AS CategorySales
FROM TopCustomers t
JOIN OrderRecords o
    ON t.CustomerName = o.CustomerName
GROUP BY t.CustomerName, t.CustomerSegment, o.ProductCategory
ORDER BY t.CustomerName, CategorySales DESC;

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Which small business customer had the highest sales?**

SELECT TOP 1 
    CustomerName,
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM OrderRecords
WHERE CustomerSegment = 'Small Business'
GROUP BY CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Which corporate customer placed the most number of orders (2009‚Äì2012)?**

SELECT TOP 1 
    CustomerName,
    COUNT(DISTINCT OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM OrderRecords
WHERE CustomerSegment = 'Corporate'
  AND YEAR(OrderDate) BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012
GROUP BY CustomerName
ORDER BY NumberOfOrders DESC;

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?**

SELECT TOP 1 
    CustomerName,
    SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit
FROM OrderRecords
WHERE CustomerSegment = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalProfit DESC;

### **üîü Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?**

SELECT DISTINCT 
    o.CustomerName,
    o.CustomerSegment,
    s.Status
FROM OrderRecords o
JOIN OrderStatus s
    ON o.OrderID = s.OrderID
WHERE s.Status = 'Returned';

### **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Was shipping cost appropriately spent based on Order Priority?**

SELECT 
    OrderPriority,
    ShipMode,
    COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders,
    AVG(ShippingCost) AS AvgShippingCost,
    AVG(Sales) AS AvgOrderValue
FROM OrderRecords
GROUP BY OrderPriority, ShipMode
ORDER BY OrderPriority, AvgShippingCost DESC;

**Interpretation:**

* ‚úÖ *High/Critical* orders should use **Express Air** (fast but costly).
* ‚úÖ *Medium/Low* orders should use **Delivery Truck** (slow but cheaper).
* ‚ùå If many low-priority orders use **Express Air**, shipping cost is being misallocated.
